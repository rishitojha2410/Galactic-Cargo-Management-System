# Galactic Cargo Management System

### COL106 Assignment, 2024

## A. Background

In the vast expanse of the galaxy, interstellar shipping companies face a critical challenge: efficiently packing cargo into their space cargo bins. Each cargo bin on a starship has a specific capacity, and each shipment of cargo comes in varying sizes and colors. Efficiently managing this cargo is essential for smooth space operations and avoiding costly delays.

A new and upcoming company, **The Galactic Cargo Management System (GCMS)**, needs your help to tackle this challenge.

The GCMS assigns unique integer IDs to both bins and objects. It handles cargo differently based on the color of the cargo, which represents special handling instructions:

1. **Blue Cargo (Compact Fit, Least ID)**: 
   - Represents standard shipments. The system uses the *Compact Fit Algorithm*. This algorithm assigns the cargo to the bin with the smallest remaining capacity that is still sufficient to hold the item. If there are multiple bins with this remaining capacity, the one with the least ID is chosen.

2. **Yellow Cargo (Compact Fit, Greatest ID)**:
   - The *Compact Fit Algorithm* is used for this color as well, with the caveat that the bin with the greatest ID is chosen in case of multiple bins with the same remaining capacity.

3. **Red Cargo (Largest Fit, Least ID)**: 
   - Represents delicate items. The system uses the *Largest Fit Algorithm*. This algorithm assigns the cargo to the bin with the largest remaining capacity. If there are multiple bins with this remaining capacity, the one with the least ID is chosen.

4. **Green Cargo (Largest Fit, Greatest ID)**:
   - The *Largest Fit Algorithm* is used for this color as well, with the caveat that the bin with the greatest ID is chosen in case of multiple bins with the same remaining capacity.

## B. Modelling

The problem in our context can be described as follows: there are `n` bins where each bin has a capacity and an ID, both of which are integers. We are also given objects in a specific order where each object has a size and an ID, both integers, along with a color as mentioned above.

### 2.1 Largest Fit Algorithm:
The *Largest Fit Algorithm* is a well-known approach for solving the bin packing problem. When adding an object to a bin, this algorithm selects the bin with the largest remaining capacity.

### 2.2 Compact Fit Algorithm:
The *Compact Fit Algorithm* selects the bin with the smallest remaining capacity that can accommodate a particular object.

## C. Requirements

The GCMS will provide a unique identifier (ID) for each object and each cargo bin, which can be any arbitrary integer. Note that two bins or two objects can have the same size.

Hereâ€™s a description of the classes and functionalities you are expected to implement:

### 3.1 GCMS

The constructor of this class initializes an empty system of cargo bins and objects. You need to implement the `GCMS` class with the following functions:

- **`add_bin(bin_id, capacity)`**: 
  - Add a new bin with a specified ID and capacity.

- **`add_object(object_id, size, color)`**: 
  - Add a new object with a specified ID, size, and color, choosing the appropriate algorithm based on the color of the object. 
  - Example: `(12345, 50, Color.RED)`
  - Note: The bin capacity is reduced by the size of the added object in this operation.

- **`delete_object(object_id)`**: 
  - Delete the object with the specified ID from its assigned bin.

- **`object_info(object_id)`**: 
  - Print the ID of the bin the object has been placed into.

- **`bin_info(bin_id)`**: 
  - Return a tuple with the first element as the remaining capacity of the bin and the second element as a list of object IDs currently stored in the bin.
  - Example: `(44, [1432, 1340, 1500])`

### 3.1.1 Clarifications:
- We assume that there are `n` bins and `m` objects in a system.
  
- **Restrictions:**
  1. You are not allowed to use Dicts (Hashing) or Sets internally implemented in Python.
  2. The program should have a space complexity of **O(n + m)**.
  3. The program should also have a time complexity of at most **O(log(n) + log(m))** for the first four functions above and **O(log(n) + S)** for the `bin_info` function, where `S` is the number of objects in the corresponding bin.
  4. If the object cannot be placed into any bin as per the algorithm, the program should raise a `NoBinFoundException`.
  5. You must not import from any new Python libraries and must implement the functionality from scratch.

## D. Usage Example

```python
gcms = GCMS()

# Adding bins
gcms.add_bin(1, 100)
gcms.add_bin(2, 150)

# Adding objects
gcms.add_object(123, 50, Color.BLUE)  # Blue cargo
gcms.add_object(124, 75, Color.RED)   # Red cargo

# Retrieving object and bin information
gcms.object_info(123)  # Should print the bin ID where object 123 is placed.
print(gcms.bin_info(1))  # Should return the remaining capacity and objects in bin 1.

# Deleting objects
gcms.delete_object(123)
